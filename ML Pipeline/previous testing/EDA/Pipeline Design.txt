Pipeline 

Stage 1 Feature Extraction: 
clean excel sheet
plot data

Stage 2 Preprocessing + Data Partitioning:
split data chronologically 60:20:20 training, validation and test sets 
*******Test split for data as a whole vs with each stock**************
*claude and gemini created different splits
save different datas, and plot before and after changes
forward fill missing data points in each data set individually 
save different datas, and plot before and after changes

Stage 2.1 Scaling data
get dataframe of training set
get dataframe of validation set 
get dataframe of test set
min max on training data and apply that scaler on the training and the validation 
min max on validation take the scaler and apply to test data
save different datas, and plot before and after changes

Stage 2.2 Trend analysis
Visualise the trend decomposition of training, validation, test set before scaling 
Visualise the trend decomposition of training, validation, test set after scaling  

Stage 3 Point and Trendline prediction Training: 
point prediction training on train set 
trendline prediction training on train set 
save the best model

Stage 3.1: Validation and HPO tuning
test model on validation set
rescale data 
calculate errors
 

Stage 4 Evaluation: 
test on test data 
rescale data 
calculate errors
